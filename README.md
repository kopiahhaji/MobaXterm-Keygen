## Installation Guide

### Step 1: Download MobaXterm
Download the latest version from the [official MobaXterm website](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download-home-edition.html).
Download third party plugin here https://download.mobatek.net/sources/

### Step 2: Generate Your Key & Customization
Use our tool to:
1. Create your activation key
2. Customize your settings (optional)
3. Merge your license with your customization (optional)

### Step 3: Activate MobaXterm
1. Locate your MobaXterm installation folder:
   - **Default Path**: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Mobatek\MobaXterm`
   - Or right-click the MobaXterm shortcut and select "Open file location"
2. Copy the `Custom.mxtpro` file to this directory
3. Start MobaXterm - your license and customizations should now be applied!

### Alternative Customization Method

MobaXterm.exe has a customizer mode that you can access by adding the parameter "-customizer":

```
.\MobaXterm.exe -customizer
```

This official tool also allows you to export your settings to a file named "MobaXterm customization.custom". Our web-based customizer provides similar functionality but is accessible directly in your browser.

## Troubleshooting

1. **Activation Not Working?**
   - Verify you're using a compatible version (20.X, 25.1, or 25.2)
   - Make sure the file is in the correct location
   - Check that the file is named exactly `Custom.mxtpro`

2. **Error During Key Generation?**
   - Ensure all form fields are filled correctly
   - Username must contain only letters (no spaces, numbers, or special characters)
   - Try refreshing the page and generating again

3. **Customization Not Applying?**
   - Verify that you've merged the customization with your license file
   - Make sure the merged file is named exactly `Custom.mxtpro`
   - Try restarting MobaXterm after placing the file in the installation directory

## Technical Details

This tool uses client-side processing to generate valid license keys and customization files based on your inputs. Everything is generated directly in your browser - no data is sent to any server, ensuring your privacy and security.
